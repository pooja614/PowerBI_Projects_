## DAX Calculations 
DAX functions are used for efficient analysis. The following are few DAX codes coded for the project. 
<pre> 
Total Sales = SUM('Fact-VrindaStores'[Amount]) 
  
Overall Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales], 
    ALL('Fact-VrindaStores'[ship-city]), 
    ALL('Dim-Category'[Category]), 
    ALL(Dates), 
    ALL('Dim-Gender'[Gender]
))

% Sales = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales],
    [Overall Sales],
    "0"
) 


% of Sales by Females = 
VAR fem_sales = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Sales],
        'Dim-Gender'[Gender] = "Women"
    )
VAR ratio = 
DIVIDE(
    fem_sales,
     [Total Sales],
     0
     )
return ratio 

Refunded % = 
VAR Refunded = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales], 
    'Dim-DeliveryStatus'[Status] = "Refunded"
) 

VAR ratio = 
    DIVIDE(
        Refunded,
        [Total Sales],
        0
    )
return ratio  

% Share in their State = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales], 
    'Fact-VrindaStores'[ship-city]
    ) 

Average Monthly Sales = 
AVERAGEX(
    Dates, 
    [Total Sales]
)

Last Month's Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales], 
    PARALLELPERIOD(
        Dates[Date], 
        -1, 
        MONTH
    )
) 

Sales MoM% Change = 
DIVIDE(
    ([Total Sales]-[Last Month's Sales]), 
    [Last Month's Sales], 
    BLANK()
)
